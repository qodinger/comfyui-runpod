# Example environment variables for deploying on RunPod
# Do NOT commit secrets. Add secrets in RunPod UI or your CI instead.

# Hugging Face (only required if pod should download model at startup)
# HF_TOKEN: your Hugging Face token (keep secret)
# HF_MODEL_ID: owner/repo (defaults to tyecode/AnythingXL)
# HF_MODEL_FILE: filename inside the repo (defaults to AnythingXL_xl.safetensors)
HF_TOKEN=
HF_MODEL_ID=tyecode/AnythingXL
HF_MODEL_FILE=AnythingXL_xl.safetensors

# RunPod S3 (only required if uploading/pre-populating the network volume)
# Create an S3 API Key in RunPod UI and set these values locally when running upload scripts
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-ca-2
# RunPod S3 endpoint (used with aws CLI --endpoint-url)
RUNPOD_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3api-us-ca-2.runpod.io

# Notes:
# - Set HF_TOKEN as a secret in RunPod when using the serverless pod to download from Hugging Face.
# - If you pre-populate the network volume at s3://<volume>/models/checkpoints/, the startup script
#   will detect the file and skip downloading, so HF_TOKEN and download envs are optional.
